Please note that \"active\" has a specific meaning for Human Resources purposes and will sometimes exclude employees on certain types of temporary leave. For hourly employees, the City is providing the hourly rate and frequency of hourly employees (40, 35, 20 and 10) to allow dataset users to estimate annual wages for hourly employees. Please note that annual wages will vary by employee, depending on number of hours worked and seasonal status.

                "description": "Crash data shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\n\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available <a href=\"https://idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual 2019.pdf\">here<\/a>.\n\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.\n\nChange 11/21/2023: We have removed the RD_NO (Chicago Police Department report number) for privacy reasons.",

The list is updated periodically when construction is completed for new projects or when the compliance period for older projects expire, typically after 30 years. The list is provided as a courtesy to the public. It does not include every City-assisted affordable housing unit that may be available for rent, nor does it include the hundreds of thousands of naturally occurring affordable housing units located throughout Chicago without City subsidies. For information on rents, income requirements and availability for the projects listed, contact each property directly. For information on other affordable rental properties in Chicago and Illinois, call (877) 428-8844, or visit www.ILHousingSearch.org.",

Inspections are performed by staff from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a database, then reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner (LEHP). For descriptions of the data elements included in this set, please click <a href=\"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/assets/BAD5301B-681A-4202-9D25-51B2CAE672FF\">here<\/a>.\n\nNote about 7/1/2018 change to food inspection procedures that affects the data in this dataset: http://bit.ly/2yWd2JB\n\nDisclaimer: Attempts have been made to minimize any and all duplicate inspection reports. However, the dataset may still contain such duplicates and the appropriate precautions should be exercised when viewing or analyzing these data. The result of the inspections (pass, pass with conditions or fail) as well as the violations noted are based on the findings identified and reported by the inspector at the time of the inspection, and may not reflect the findings noted at other times.

The Board has, since 2000, compiled and posted static lists of all lobbyists and their clients online. Data for the 2010 reporting period is limited because previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. \r\nMoving forward, the Board of Ethics will compile and report more data about lobbyists and their activities, and make that additional information publicly available in machine-readable format. /  \r\nData Owner:  Board of Ethics \r\n[http://j.mp/mbH9BN] /\r\n\r\nTime Period: January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 /\r\nRelated Applications:  Registered Lobbyist List [http://j.mp/l8LwAq], \r\n2011 Lobbyist Registry  [http://j.mp/ifigjs]",

This dataset contains a large number of records/rows of data and may not be viewed in full in Microsoft Excel. Therefore, when downloading the file, select CSV from the Export menu. Open the file in an ASCII text editor, such as Notepad or Wordpad, to view and search. \n \nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \n\nAPPLICATION TYPE:  ‘ISSUE’ is the record associated with the initial license application.  ‘RENEW’ is a subsequent renewal record.  All renewal records are created with a term start date and term expiration date.  ‘C_LOC’ is a change of location record.  It means the business moved.   ‘C_CAPA’ is a change of capacity record.  Only a few license types may file this type of application.  ‘C_EXPA’ only applies to businesses that have liquor licenses.  It means the business location expanded.  'C_SBA' is a change of business activity record. It means that a new business activity was added or an existing business activity was marked as expired.\n\nLICENSE STATUS: ‘AAI’ means the license was issued. ‘AAC’ means the license was cancelled during its term.  ‘REV’ means the license was revoked. 'REA' means the license revocation has been appealed.\n\nLICENSE STATUS CHANGE DATE:  This date corresponds to the date a license was cancelled (AAC), revoked (REV) or appealed (REA).\n\nBusiness License Owner information may be accessed at:  https://data.cityofchicago.org/dataset/Business-Owners/ezma-pppn. To identify the owner of a business, you will need the account number or legal name, which may be obtained from this Business Licenses dataset. \n\nData Owner: Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. Time Period: January 1, 2002 to present. Frequency: Data is updated daily.",
