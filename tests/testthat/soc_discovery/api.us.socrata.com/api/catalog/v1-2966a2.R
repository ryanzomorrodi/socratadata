Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\\n\\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available <a href=\\\"https://idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual 2019.pdf\\\">here</a>.\\n\\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.\\n\\nChange 11/21/2023: We have removed the RD_NO (Chicago Police Department report number) for privacy reasons.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"City of Chicago\",\n            \"attribution_link\" : \"http://www.chicago.gov\",\n            \"contact_email\" : null,\n            \"type\" : \"dataset\",\n            \"updatedAt\" : \"2025-07-16T16:01:53.000Z\",\n            \"createdAt\" : \"2017-10-19T22:02:56.000Z\",\n            \"metadata_updated_at\" : \"2023-12-13T16:58:25.000Z\",\n            \"data_updated_at\" : \"2025-07-16T16:01:53.000Z\",\n            \"page_views\" :\n              {\n                \"page_views_last_week\" : 2652,\n                \"page_views_last_month\" : 18274,\n                \"page_views_total\" : 655814,\n                \"page_views_last_week_log\" : 11.373408960228696,\n                \"page_views_last_month_log\" : 14.157583785727164,\n                \"page_views_total_log\" : 19.322929374304607\n              },\n            \"columns_name\" :\n              [\n                \"DAMAGE\",\n                \"CRASH_RECORD_ID\",\n                \"CRASH_DATE_EST_I\",\n                \"CRASH_DATE\",\n                \"POSTED_SPEED_LIMIT\",\n                \"TRAFFIC_CONTROL_DEVICE\",\n                \"DEVICE_CONDITION\",\n                \"WEATHER_CONDITION\",\n                \"LIGHTING_CONDITION\",\n                \"FIRST_CRASH_TYPE\",\n                \"TRAFFICWAY_TYPE\",\n                \"LANE_CNT\",\n                \"ALIGNMENT\",\n                \"ROADWAY_SURFACE_COND\",\n                \"ROAD_DEFECT\",\n                \"REPORT_TYPE\",\n                \"CRASH_TYPE\",\n                \"INTERSECTION_RELATED_I\",\n                \"NOT_RIGHT_OF_WAY_I\",\n                \"HIT_AND_RUN_I\",\n                \"DATE_POLICE_NOTIFIED\",\n                \"PRIM_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE\",\n                \"SEC_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE\",\n                \"STREET_NO\",\n                \"STREET_DIRECTION\",\n                \"STREET_NAME\",\n                \"BEAT_OF_OCCURRENCE\",\n                \"PHOTOS_TAKEN_I\",\n                \"STATEMENTS_TAKEN_I\",\n                \"DOORING_I\",\n                \"WORK_ZONE_I\",\n                \"WORK_ZONE_TYPE\",\n                \"WORKERS_PRESENT_I\",\n                \"NUM_UNITS\",\n                \"MOST_SEVERE_INJURY\",\n                \"INJURIES_TOTAL\",\n                \"INJURIES_FATAL\",\n                \"INJURIES_INCAPACITATING\",\n                \"INJURIES_NON_INCAPACITATING\",\n                \"INJURIES_REPORTED_NOT_EVIDENT\",\n                \"INJURIES_NO_INDICATION\",\n                \"INJURIES_UNKNOWN\",\n                \"CRASH_HOUR\",\n                \"CRASH_DAY_OF_WEEK\",\n                \"CRASH_MONTH\",\n                \"LATITUDE\",\n                \"LONGITUDE\",\n                \"LOCATION\",\n                \"Boundaries -

This dataset should be used in conjunction with the traffic Crash and People dataset available in the portal. “Vehicle” information includes motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle modes of transportation, such as bicycles and pedestrians. Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a “unit” and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of “units” is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the “CRASH_RECORD_ID” field. Since this dataset is a combination of vehicles, pedestrians, and pedal cyclists not all columns are applicable to each record. Look at the Unit Type field to determine what additional data may be available for that record.\\n\\nThe Chicago Police Department reports crashes on IL Traffic Crash Reporting form SR1050.

For a more detailed description,  please go to https://tas.chicago.gov, click the About button at the bottom of the page, and then the MAP LAYERS tab.\\n\\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (nonfreeway\\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\\n\\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area).\\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"City of Chicago\",\n            \"attribution_link\" : \"http://www.chicagotraffictracker.com/\",\n            \"contact_email\" : null,\n            \"type\" : \"dataset\",\n            \"updatedAt\" : \"2025-07-16T19:05:29.000Z\",\n            \"createdAt\" : \"2011-11-20T03:28:25.000Z\",\n            \"metadata_updated_at\" : \"2025-02-10T18:57:39.000Z\",\n            \"data_updated_at\" : \"2025-07-16T19:05:29.000Z\",\n            \"page_views\" :\n              {\n                \"page_views_last_week\" : 295,\n                \"page_views_last_month\" : 1688,\n                \"page_views_total\" : 78899,\n                \"page_views_last_week_log\" : 8.20945336562895,\n                \"page_views_last_month_log\" : 10.721953612801386,\n                \"page_views_total_log\" : 16.267737679788183\n              },\n            \"columns_name\" :\n              [\n                \" END_LATITUDE\",\n                \" CURRENT_SPEED\",\n                \"STREET\",\n                \"END_LONGITUDE\",\n                \" STREET_HEADING\",\n                \"START_LONGITUDE\",\n                \"TO_STREET\",\n                \" LAST_UPDATED\",\n                \" START_LATITUDE\",\n                \"LENGTH\",\n                \"DIRECTION\",\n                \" COMMENTS\",\n                \"FROM_STREET\",\n                \"SEGMENTID\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_field_name\" :\n              [\n                \"_lit_lat\",\n                \"_traffic\",\n                \"street\",\n                \"_lit_lon\",\n                \"_strheading\",\n                \"start_lon\",\n                \"_tost\",\n                \"_last_updt\",\n                \"_lif_lat\",\n                \"_length\",\n                \"_direction\",\n                \"_comments\",\n                \"_fromst\",\n                \"segmentid\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_datatype\" :\n              [\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_description\" :\n              [\n                \"\",\n                \"A value of -1 means no estimate is available.\",\n                \"Street name of the traffic segment.\",\n                \"\",\n                \"The position of the segment in the address grid.

For recent data, we recommend using https://chicagotraffictracker.com. -- Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\\nData Owner: Transportation.\\nTime Period: 2006.\\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years.

For a detailed description, please go to https://tas.chicago.gov, click the About button at the bottom of the page, and then the MAP LAYERS tab. \\n\\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). \\n\\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.\",\n            \"attribution\" : null,\n            \"attribution_link\" : null,\n            \"contact_email\" : null,\n            \"type\" : \"dataset\",\n            \"updatedAt\" : \"2025-07-16T19:03:17.000Z\",\n            \"createdAt\" : \"2011-11-20T03:43:27.000Z\",\n            \"metadata_updated_at\" : \"2025-02-10T18:56:40.000Z\",\n            \"data_updated_at\" : \"2025-07-16T19:03:17.000Z\",\n            \"page_views\" :\n              {\n                \"page_views_last_week\" : 228,\n                \"page_views_last_month\" : 1568,\n                \"page_views_total\" : 70864,\n                \"page_views_last_week_log\" : 7.8392037880969445,\n                \"page_views_last_month_log\" : 10.615629636968098,\n                \"page_views_total_log\" : 16.112785640386978\n              },\n            \"columns_name\" :\n              [\n                \" WEST\",\n                \" SOUTH\",\n                \" EAST\",\n                \"REGION\",\n                \" REGION_ID\",\n                \" LAST_UPDATED\",\n                \" CURRENT_SPEED\",\n                \" DESCRIPTION\",\n                \" NORTH\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_field_name\" :\n              [\n                \"_west\",\n                \"_south\",\n                \"_east\",\n                \"region\",\n                \"_region_id\",\n                \"_last_updt\",\n                \"current_speed\",\n                \"_description\",\n                \"_north\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_datatype\" :\n              [\n                \"Number\",\n                \"Number\",\n                \"Number\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Number\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Number\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Number\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_description\" :\n              [\n                \"Approximate longitude of the west edge of the region.\",\n                \"Approximate latitude of the south edge of the region.\",\n                \"Approximate longitude of the east edge of the region.\",\n                \"Name of the region.\",\n                \"Unique arbitrary number to represent each region.\",\n                \"Timestamp of the last update.\",\n                \"Estimated congestion level.
