Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\\n\\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available <a href=\\\"https://idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual 2019.pdf\\\">here</a>.\\n\\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.\\n\\nChange 11/21/2023: We have removed the RD_NO (Chicago Police Department report number) for privacy reasons.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"City of Chicago\",\n            \"attribution_link\" : \"http://www.chicago.gov\",\n            \"contact_email\" : null,\n            \"type\" : \"dataset\",\n            \"updatedAt\" : \"2025-08-18T15:45:45.000Z\",\n            \"createdAt\" : \"2017-10-19T22:02:56.000Z\",\n            \"metadata_updated_at\" : \"2023-12-13T16:58:25.000Z\",\n            \"data_updated_at\" : \"2025-08-18T15:45:45.000Z\",\n            \"page_views\" :\n              {\n                \"page_views_last_week\" : 4946,\n                \"page_views_last_month\" : 21351,\n                \"page_views_total\" : 678811,\n                \"page_views_last_week_log\" : 12.272338184158624,\n                \"page_views_last_month_log\" : 14.382083590141969,\n                \"page_views_total_log\" : 19.37265254342385\n              },\n            \"columns_name\" :\n              [\n                \"DAMAGE\",\n                \"PRIM_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE\",\n                \"SEC_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE\",\n                \"DOORING_I\",\n                \"NUM_UNITS\",\n                \"WORKERS_PRESENT_I\",\n                \"INJURIES_TOTAL\",\n                \"INJURIES_FATAL\",\n                \"INJURIES_INCAPACITATING\",\n                \"WEATHER_CONDITION\",\n                \"DEVICE_CONDITION\",\n                \"TRAFFIC_CONTROL_DEVICE\",\n                \"INJURIES_NON_INCAPACITATING\",\n                \"POSTED_SPEED_LIMIT\",\n                \"INJURIES_REPORTED_NOT_EVIDENT\",\n                \"INJURIES_NO_INDICATION\",\n                \"INJURIES_UNKNOWN\",\n                \"CRASH_HOUR\",\n                \"CRASH_DAY_OF_WEEK\",\n                \"CRASH_MONTH\",\n                \"LATITUDE\",\n                \"LONGITUDE\",\n                \"CRASH_DATE\",\n                \"CRASH_DATE_EST_I\",\n                \"CRASH_RECORD_ID\",\n                \"Boundaries -

Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of “units” is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the “CRASH_RECORD_ID” field. Since this dataset is a combination of vehicles, pedestrians, and pedal cyclists not all columns are applicable to each record. Look at the Unit Type field to determine what additional data may be available for that record.\\n\\nThe Chicago Police Department reports crashes on IL Traffic Crash Reporting form SR1050.

The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"City of Chicago\",\n            \"attribution_link\" : \"http://www.chicagotraffictracker.com/\",\n            \"contact_email\" : null,\n            \"type\" : \"dataset\",\n            \"updatedAt\" : \"2025-08-18T16:07:47.000Z\",\n            \"createdAt\" : \"2011-11-20T03:28:25.000Z\",\n            \"metadata_updated_at\" : \"2025-02-10T18:57:39.000Z\",\n            \"data_updated_at\" : \"2025-08-18T16:07:47.000Z\",\n            \"page_views\" :\n              {\n                \"page_views_last_week\" : 457,\n                \"page_views_last_month\" : 1916,\n                \"page_views_total\" : 81006,\n                \"page_views_last_week_log\" : 8.839203788096945,\n                \"page_views_last_month_log\" : 10.904634621668151,\n                \"page_views_total_log\" : 16.305758959508942\n              },\n            \"columns_name\" :\n              [\n                \"START_LONGITUDE\",\n                \" START_LATITUDE\",\n                \"LENGTH\",\n                \"STREET\",\n                \"DIRECTION\",\n                \" END_LATITUDE\",\n                \" CURRENT_SPEED\",\n                \"TO_STREET\",\n                \"FROM_STREET\",\n                \" LAST_UPDATED\",\n                \"SEGMENTID\",\n                \"END_LONGITUDE\",\n                \" COMMENTS\",\n                \" STREET_HEADING\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_field_name\" :\n              [\n                \"start_lon\",\n                \"_lif_lat\",\n                \"_length\",\n                \"street\",\n                \"_direction\",\n                \"_lit_lat\",\n                \"_traffic\",\n                \"_tost\",\n                \"_fromst\",\n                \"_last_updt\",\n                \"segmentid\",\n                \"_lit_lon\",\n                \"_comments\",\n                \"_strheading\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_datatype\" :\n              [\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\",\n                \"Text\"\n              ],\n            \"columns_description\" :\n              [\n                \"The longitude associated with the starting point of the segment in the direction of traffic flow.
