congestion measures the hours drivers are in congestion on freeway facilities based on traffic data. In recent years, data for the Bay Area comes from INRIX, a company that collects real-time traffic information from a variety of sources including mobile phone data and other GPS locator devices. The data provides traffic speed on the region’s highways. Using historical INRIX data (and similar internal datasets for some of the earlier years), MTC calculates an annual time series for vehicle hours spent in congestion in the Bay Area. Time spent in congestion is defined as the average daily hours spent in congestion on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays during peak traffic months on freeway facilities. This indicator focuses on weekdays given that traffic congestion is generally greater on these days; this indicator does not capture traffic congestion on local streets due to data unavailability.\\n\\nThis congestion indicator emphasizes recurring delay (as opposed to also including non-recurring delay), capturing the extent of delay caused by routine traffic volumes (rather than congestion caused by unusual circumstances). Recurring delay is identified by setting a threshold of consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment from vehicle speeds less than 35 mph. This definition is consistent with longstanding practices by MTC, Caltrans and the U.S. Department of Transportation as speeds less than 35 mph result in significantly less efficient traffic operations. 35 mph is the threshold at which vehicle throughput is greatest; speeds that are either greater than or less than 35 mph result in reduced vehicle throughput. This methodology focuses on the extra travel time experienced based on a differential between the congested speed and 35 mph, rather than the posted speed limit.\\n\\nTo provide a mathematical example of how the indicator is calculated on a segment basis, when it comes to time spent in congestion, 1,000 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for a 1/4 hour (15 minutes) each, [1,000 vehicles x ¼ hour congestion per vehicle= 250 hours congestion], is equivalent to 100 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for 2.5 hours each, [100 vehicles x 2.5 hour congestion per vehicle = 250 hours congestion]. In this way, the measure captures the impacts of both slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. \\n\\nMTC calculates two measures of delay – congested delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below 35 miles per hour, and total delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below the posted speed limit. To illustrate, if 1,000 vehicles are traveling at 30 miles per hour on a one mile long segment, this would represent 4.76 vehicle hours of congested delay [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 35 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours – 28.57 vehicle hours = 4.76 vehicle hours]. Considering that the posted speed limit on the segment is 60 miles per hour, total delay would be calculated as 16.67 vehicle hours [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 60 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours – 16.67 vehicle hours = 16.67 vehicle hours]. \\n\\nData sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy t\",\n            \"attribution\" : null,\n

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county, city and census tract tables by place of residence.\\n\\nDATA SOURCE\\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1960-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census\\nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19802000.htm\\n\\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\\nForm B08301 (2006-2018; place of residence)\\nwww.api.census.gov\\n\\nCONTACT INFORMATION\\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\\nFor the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. \\\"Other\\\" includes bicycle, motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation.\\n\\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Regional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties’ modal shares. \\\"Auto\\\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. “Transit” includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \\\"Other\\\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\\n\\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"U.S. Census Bureau\",\n            \"attribution_link\" : \"https://data.census.gov\",\n            \"contact_email\" : null,\n            \"type\" : \"dataset\",\n            \"updatedAt\" : \"2020-05-20T21:50:47.000Z\",\n            \"createdAt\" : \"2020-04-09T17:01:10.000Z\",\n            \"metadata_updated_at\" : \"2020-05-20T21:50:47.000Z\",\n            \"data_updated_at\" : \"2020-04-15T20:55:37.000Z\",\n            \"page_views\" :\n              {\n                \"page_views_last_week\" : 2,\n                \"page_views_last_month\" : 8,\n                \"page_views_total\" : 475,\n                \"page_views_last_week_log\" : 1.5849625007211563,\n                \"page_views_last_month_log\" : 3.1699250014423126,\n                \"page_views_total_log\" : 8.894817763307945\n              },\n            \"columns_name\" :\n              [ \"Share\", \"Source\", \"Region\", \"Data_Type\", \"Year\", \"Mode\" ],\n            \"columns_field_name\" :\n              [ \"share\", \"source\", \"region\", \"data_type\", \"year\", \"mode\" ],\n            \"columns_datatype\" :\n              [ \"Number\", \"Text\", \"Text\", \"Text\", \"Number\", \"Text\" ],\n            \"columns_description\" : [ \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\" ],\n            \"columns_format\" : [ {}, {}, {}, {}, { \"noCommas\" : \"true\" }, {} ],\n            \"download_count\" : 59,\n            \"provenance\" : \"official\",\n            \"lens_view_type\" : \"tabular\",\n            \"lens_display_type\" : \"table\",\n            \"locked\" : false,\n            \"blob_mime_type\" : null,\n            \"hide_from_data_json\" : false,\n            \"publication_date\" : \"2020-04-09T17:07:03.000Z\"\n          },\n        \"classification\" :\n          {\n            \"categories\" : [ \"transportation\", \"demographics\" ],\n            \"tags\" : [],\n            \"domain_tags\" : [ \"vital signs\" ],\n            \"domain_metadata\" : []\n          },\n        \"metadata\" : { \"domain\" : \"data.bayareametro.gov\" },\n        \"permalink\" : \"https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/9mau-as85\",\n        \"link\" : \"https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Reside/9mau-as85\",\n        \"owner\" :\n          {\n            \"id\" : \"wg3i-tdm6\",\n            \"user_type\" : \"interactive\",\n            \"display_name\" : \"Raleigh McCoy\"\n          },\n        \"creator\" :\n          {\n            \"id\" : \"wg3i-tdm6\",\n            \"user_type\" : \"interactive\",\n            \"display_name\" : \"Raleigh McCoy\"\n          }\n      },\n      {\n        \"resource\" :\n          {\n            \"name\" : \"Public Assistance Case Denials by Reason for Denial: Beginning 2006\",\n            \"id\" : \"tyyj-jgv5\",\n            \"resource_name\" : null,\n            \"parent_fxf\" : [],\n            \"description\" : \"This dataset, from New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, provides the number of Public Assistance case denials in each month by reason for case denial, for each Local Social Services District (SSD).

This program builds on the work of the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program. SAHIE is only source of single-year health insurance coverage estimates for all U.S. counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2008-2014, SAHIE publishes STATE and COUNTY estimates of population with and without health insurance coverage, along with measures of uncertainty, for the full cross-classification of:\\r\\n•5 age categories: 0-64, 18-64, 21-64, 40-64, and 50-64\\r\\n\\r\\n•3 sex categories: both sexes, male, and female\\r\\n\\r\\n•6 income categories: all incomes, as well as income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories 0-138%, 0-200%, 0-250%, 0-400%, and 138-400% of the poverty threshold\\r\\n\\r\\n•4 races/ethnicities (for states only): all races/ethnicities, White not Hispanic, Black not Hispanic, and Hispanic (any race).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, estimates for age category 0-18 by the income categories listed above are published.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year’s estimates are adjusted so that, before rounding, the county estimates sum to their respective state totals and for key demographics the state estimates sum to the national ACS numbers insured and uninsured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis program is partially funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC), National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection ProgramLink to a non-federal Web site (NBCCEDP). The CDC have a congressional mandate to provide screening services for breast and cervical cancer to low-income, uninsured, and underserved women through the NBCCEDP. Most state NBCCEDP programs define low-income as 200 or 250 percent of the poverty threshold. Also included are IPR categories relevant to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2014, the ACA will help families gain access to health care by allowing Medicaid to cover families with incomes less than or equal to 138 percent of the poverty line. Families with incomes above the level needed to qualify for Medicaid, but less than or equal to 400 percent of the poverty line can receive tax credits that will help them pay for health coverage in the new health insurance exchanges. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe welcome your feedback as we continue to research and improve our estimation methods. The SAHIE program's age model methodology and estimates have undergone internal U.S. Census Bureau review as well as external review. See the SAHIE Methodological Review page for more details and a summary of the comments and our response. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAHIE program models health insurance coverage by combining survey data from several sources, including:\\r\\n•The American Community Survey (ACS)\\r\\n•Demographic population estimates\\r\\n•Aggregated federal tax returns\\r\\n•Participation records for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp program\\r\\n•County Business Patterns\\r\\n•Medicaid\\r\\n•Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) participation records\\r\\n•Census 2010\\r\\n\\r\\nMargin of error (MOE). Some ACS products provide\\r\\nan MOE instead of confidence intervals. An MOE is the\\r\\ndifference between an estimate and its upper or lower\\r\\nconfidence bounds. Confidence bounds can be created\\r\\nby adding the margin of error to the estimate (for the\\r\\nupper bound) and subtracting the margin of error from\\r\\nthe estimate (for the lower bound). All published ACS\\r\\nmargins of error are based on a 90-percent confidence\\r\\nlevel.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"Small Area Health Insurance Estimates Program, U.S. Census Bureau\",\n

The U.S. Census Bureau must adhere to the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards on race and ethnicity which guide the Census Bureau in classifying written responses to the race question: American Indian or Alaska Native – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. The 1997 OMB standards permit the reporting of more than one race. An individual’s response to the race question is based upon self-identification. An individual’s response to the race question is based upon self-identification. The Census Bureau does not tell individuals which boxes to mark or what heritage to write in. For the first time in Census 2000, individuals were presented with the option to self-identify with more than one race and this continued with the 2010 Census. People who identify with more than one race may choose to provide multiple races in response to the race question. For example, if a respondent identifies as \\\"Asian\\\" and \\\"White,\\\" they may respond to the question on race by checking the appropriate boxes that describe their racial identities and/or writing in these identities on the spaces provided. What is Race? The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of individuals in the United States. The Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. OMB requires five minimum categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Reasons for collecting information on race Information on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights. States use these data to meet legislative redistricting principles. Race data also are used to promote equal employment opportunities and to assess racial disparities in health and environmental risks.

The U.S. Census Bureau must adhere to the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards on race and ethnicity which guide the Census Bureau in classifying written responses to the race question:White – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.Black or African American – A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.American Indian or Alaska Native – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.Asian – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.The 1997 OMB standards permit the reporting of more than one race. An individual’s response to the race question is based upon self-identification. An individual’s response to the race question is based upon self-identification. The Census Bureau does not tell individuals which boxes to mark or what heritage to write in. For the first time in Census 2000, individuals were presented with the option to self-identify with more than one race and this continued with the 2010 Census. People who identify with more than one race may choose to provide multiple races in response to the race question. For example, if a respondent identifies as \\\"Asian\\\" and \\\"White,\\\" they may respond to the question on race by checking the appropriate boxes that describe their racial identities and/or writing in these identities on the spaces provided.What is Race?The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of individuals in the United States. The Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification.The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups.

several mobile data providers, a step taken to address the reduce the risks of geographic and temporal sample bias that would result from using a single data source. In turn, the merged data panel only included data from those mobile devices whose anonymized location data met a set of data quality standards, e.g., temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, device-level temporal coverage and representativeness, spatial distribution of data at the sample and county levels. After this filtering, final mobility estimate statistics were computed using a multi-level weighting method that employed both device- and trip-level weights, thus expanding the sample represented by the devices in the data panel to the at-large populations of each state and county in the US.\\n\\nData analysis was conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels.  To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data were reported for a county if it had fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.\\n\\nTrips were defined as movements that included a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes--before returning home--was counted as multiple trips.\\n\\nThe Daily Mobility Statistics data on this page, which cover the COVID and Post-COVID periods, are experimental.  Experimental data products are created using novel or exploratory data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other statistically rigorous products, and they not meet all
