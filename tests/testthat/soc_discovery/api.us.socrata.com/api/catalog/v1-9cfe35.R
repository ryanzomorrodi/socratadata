(T1)\\n\\nFULL MEASURE NAME\\nCommute mode share by residential location\\n\\nLAST UPDATED\\nApril 2020\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\nCommute mode choice, also known as commute mode share, refers to the mode of transportation that a commuter uses to travel to work, such as driving alone, biking, carpooling or taking transit. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county, city and census tract tables by place of residence.\\n\\nDATA SOURCE\\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1960-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census\\nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19802000.htm\\n\\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\\nForm B08301 (2006-2018; place of residence)\\nwww.api.census.gov\\n\\nCONTACT INFORMATION\\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\\nFor the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. \\\"Other\\\" includes bicycle, motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation.\\n\\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Regional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties’ modal shares. \\\"Auto\\\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. “Transit” includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \\\"Other\\\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\\n\\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"U.S. Census Bureau\",\n            \"attribution_link\" : \"https://data.census.gov\",\n            \"contact_email\" : null,\n            \"type\" : \"dataset\",\n            \"updatedAt\" : \"2020-05-20T21:50:47.000Z\",\n            \"createdAt\" : \"2020-04-09T17:01:10.000Z\",\n            \"metadata_updated_at\" : \"2020-05-20T21:50:47.000Z\",\n            \"data_updated_at\" : \"2020-04-15T20:55:37.000Z\",\n            \"page_views\" :\n              {\n                \"page_views_last_week\" : 3,\n                \"page_views_last_month\" : 8,\n                \"page_views_total\" : 466,\n                \"page_views_last_week_log\" : 2.0,\n                \"page_views_last_month_log\" : 3.1699250014423126,\n                \"page_views_total_log\" : 8.867278739709663\n              },\n            \"columns_name\" :\n              [ \"Share\", \"Region\", \"Source\", \"Data_Type\", \"Year\", \"Mode\" ],\n            \"columns_field_name\" :\n              [ \"share\", \"region\", \"source\", \"data_type\", \"year\", \"mode\" ],\n            \"columns_datatype\" :\n              [ \"Number\", \"Text\", \"Text\", \"Text\", \"Number\", \"Text\" ],\n            \"columns_description\" : [ \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\" ],\n            \"columns_format\" : [ {}, {}, {}, {}, { \"noCommas\" : \"true\" }, {} ],\n            \"download_count\" : 56,\n            \"provenance\" : \"official\",\n            \"lens_view_type\" : \"tabular\",\n            \"lens_display_type\" : \"table\",\n            \"locked\" : false,\n            \"blob_mime_type\" : null,\n            \"hide_from_data_json\" : false,\n            \"publication_date\" : \"2020-04-09T17:07:03.000Z\"\n          },\n        \"classification\" :\n          {\n            \"categories\" : [ \"transportation\", \"demographics\" ],\n            \"tags\" : [],\n            \"domain_tags\" : [ \"vital signs\" ],\n            \"domain_metadata\" : []\n          },\n        \"metadata\" : { \"domain\" : \"data.bayareametro.gov\" },\n        \"permalink\" : \"https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/9mau-as85\",\n        \"link\" : \"https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Reside/9mau-as85\",\n        \"owner\" :\n          {\n            \"id\" : \"wg3i-tdm6\",\n            \"user_type\" : \"interactive\",\n            \"display_name\" : \"Raleigh McCoy\"\n          },\n        \"creator\" :\n          {\n            \"id\" : \"wg3i-tdm6\",\n            \"user_type\" : \"interactive\",\n            \"display_name\" : \"Raleigh McCoy\"\n          }\n      },\n      {\n        \"resource\" :\n          {\n            \"name\" : \"Senior management expenses\",\n            \"id\" : \"y3tg-gbwj\",\n            \"resource_name\" : null,\n            \"parent_fxf\" : [],\n            \"description\" : \"As part of The City of Calgary's commitment to an open, transparent and accountable local government we release the Senior Management Expense report twice per year in the spring and fall.

datasets for this indicator)\\nTime spent in congestion measures the hours drivers are in congestion on freeway facilities based on traffic data. In recent years, data for the Bay Area comes from INRIX, a company that collects real-time traffic information from a variety of sources including mobile phone data and other GPS locator devices. The data provides traffic speed on the region’s highways. Using historical INRIX data (and similar internal datasets for some of the earlier years), MTC calculates an annual time series for vehicle hours spent in congestion in the Bay Area. Time spent in congestion is defined as the average daily hours spent in congestion on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays during peak traffic months on freeway facilities. This indicator focuses on weekdays given that traffic congestion is generally greater on these days; this indicator does not capture traffic congestion on local streets due to data unavailability.\\n\\nThis congestion indicator emphasizes recurring delay (as opposed to also including non-recurring delay), capturing the extent of delay caused by routine traffic volumes (rather than congestion caused by unusual circumstances). Recurring delay is identified by setting a threshold of consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment from vehicle speeds less than 35 mph. This definition is consistent with longstanding practices by MTC, Caltrans and the U.S. Department of Transportation as speeds less than 35 mph result in significantly less efficient traffic operations. 35 mph is the threshold at which vehicle throughput is greatest; speeds that are either greater than or less than 35 mph result in reduced vehicle throughput. This methodology focuses on the extra travel time experienced based on a differential between the congested speed and 35 mph, rather than the posted speed limit.\\n\\nTo provide a mathematical example of how the indicator is calculated on a segment basis, when it comes to time spent in congestion, 1,000 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for a 1/4 hour (15 minutes) each, [1,000 vehicles x ¼ hour congestion per vehicle= 250 hours congestion], is equivalent to 100 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for 2.5 hours each, [100 vehicles x 2.5 hour congestion per vehicle = 250 hours congestion]. In this way, the measure captures the impacts of both slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. \\n\\nMTC calculates two measures of delay – congested delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below 35 miles per hour, and total delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below the posted speed limit. To illustrate, if 1,000 vehicles are traveling at 30 miles per hour on a one mile long segment, this would represent 4.76 vehicle hours of congested delay [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 35 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours – 28.57 vehicle hours = 4.76 vehicle hours]. Considering that the posted speed limit on the segment is 60 miles per hour, total delay would be calculated as 16.67 vehicle hours [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 60 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours – 16.67 vehicle hours = 16.67 vehicle hours]. \\n\\nData sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy t\",\n            \"attribution\" : null,\n

Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \\\"Covered\\\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice.

This program builds on the work of the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program. SAHIE is only source of single-year health insurance coverage estimates for all U.S. counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2008-2014, SAHIE publishes STATE and COUNTY estimates of population with and without health insurance coverage, along with measures of uncertainty, for the full cross-classification of:\\r\\n•5 age categories: 0-64, 18-64, 21-64, 40-64, and 50-64\\r\\n\\r\\n•3 sex categories: both sexes, male, and female\\r\\n\\r\\n•6 income categories: all incomes, as well as income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories 0-138%, 0-200%, 0-250%, 0-400%, and 138-400% of the poverty threshold\\r\\n\\r\\n•4 races/ethnicities (for states only): all races/ethnicities, White not Hispanic, Black not Hispanic, and Hispanic (any race).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, estimates for age category 0-18 by the income categories listed above are published.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year’s estimates are adjusted so that, before rounding, the county estimates sum to their respective state totals and for key demographics the state estimates sum to the national ACS numbers insured and uninsured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis program is partially funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC), National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection ProgramLink to a non-federal Web site (NBCCEDP). The CDC have a congressional mandate to provide screening services for breast and cervical cancer to low-income, uninsured, and underserved women through the NBCCEDP. Most state NBCCEDP programs define low-income as 200 or 250 percent of the poverty threshold. Also included are IPR categories relevant to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2014, the ACA will help families gain access to health care by allowing Medicaid to cover families with incomes less than or equal to 138 percent of the poverty line. Families with incomes above the level needed to qualify for Medicaid, but less than or equal to 400 percent of the poverty line can receive tax credits that will help them pay for health coverage in the new health insurance exchanges. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe welcome your feedback as we continue to research and improve our estimation methods. The SAHIE program's age model methodology and estimates have undergone internal U.S. Census Bureau review as well as external review. See the SAHIE Methodological Review page for more details and a summary of the comments and our response. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAHIE program models health insurance coverage by combining survey data from several sources, including:\\r\\n•The American Community Survey (ACS)\\r\\n•Demographic population estimates\\r\\n•Aggregated federal tax returns\\r\\n•Participation records for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp program\\r\\n•County Business Patterns\\r\\n•Medicaid\\r\\n•Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) participation records\\r\\n•Census 2010\\r\\n\\r\\nMargin of error (MOE). Some ACS products provide\\r\\nan MOE instead of confidence intervals. An MOE is the\\r\\ndifference between an estimate and its upper or lower\\r\\nconfidence bounds. Confidence bounds can be created\\r\\nby adding the margin of error to the estimate (for the\\r\\nupper bound) and subtracting the margin of error from\\r\\nthe estimate (for the lower bound). All published ACS\\r\\nmargins of error are based on a 90-percent confidence\\r\\nlevel.\",\n            \"attribution\" : \"Small Area Health Insurance Estimates Program, U.S. Census Bureau\",\n

For example, if a respondent identifies as \\\"Asian\\\" and \\\"White,\\\" they may respond to the question on race by checking the appropriate boxes that describe their racial identities and/or writing in these identities on the spaces provided.What is Race?The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of individuals in the United States. The Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification.The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.OMB requires five minimum categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.Reasons for collecting information on raceInformation on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights. States use these data to meet legislative redistricting principles. Race data also are used to promote equal employment opportunities and to assess racial disparities in health and environmental risks.Contact UsFor assistance, please contact the Census Call Center at 1-800-923-8282 (toll free) or visit ask.census.gov for further information.More info on race - https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about/faq.html\",\n                \"Margin of Error percentage of females that do not have insurance in this county. \\n\\nMargin of Error average of  females that do not have insurance at the bottom of this column\",\n                \"Percentage of females that do not have insurance in this county. \\n\\nAverage percentage of  females that do not have insurance at the bottom of this column\",\n                \"Count of all females that do not have insurance in this county. \\n\\nSum of all females that do not have insurance for all counties at the bottom of this column\",\n                \"Margin of Error count of all females in this county. \\n\\nMargin of Error sum of all females for all counties at the bottom of this column\",\n                \"Count of all females in this county. \\n\\nSum of all females for all counties at the bottom of this column\",\n                \"Margin of Error percentage of males that do not have insurance in this county. \\n\\nMargin of Error average of  males that do not have insurance at the bottom of this column. \",\n                \"Percentage of males that do not have insurance in this county. \\n\\nAn average percentage of males that do not have insurance at the bottom of this column. \",\n                \"Margin of Error count of all males that do not have insurance in this county. \\nMargin of Error sum of all males that do not have insurance at the bottom of this column. \",\n                \"A count of all males that do not have insurance in this county. \\n\\nA sum of all males that do not have insurance at the bottom of this column. \",\n                \"Margin of Error Percentage of individuals that do not have insurance that are 19 years of age to 25 years of age. \\n\\nMargin of Error Average percentage of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Percentage of individuals that do not have insurance that are 19 years of age to 25 years of age. \\n\\nAverage percentage of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Margin of Error Count of individuals that do not have insurance that are 19 years of age to 25 years of age. \\n\\nMargin of Error Sum of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Count of individuals that do not have insurance that are 19 years of age to 25 years of age. \\n\\nSum of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Count of all individuals that are 19 years of age to 25 years of age. \\n\\nSum of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Margin of Error Percentage of uninsured individuals that are 65 years of age and older\\n\\nAverage of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Margin of Error Count of uninsured individuals that are 65 years of age and older\\n\\nSum of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Count of uninsured individuals that are 65 years of age and older\\n\\nSum of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Margin of Error Count of all individuals that are 65 years of age and older\\n\\nMargin of Error Sum of all rows at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"Margin of Error Percentage of uninsured individuals that are 18 years of age to 64 years of age\\n\\nLogical Average of all rows in this view at the bottom\",\n                \"Percentage of uninsured individuals that are 18 years of age to 64 years of age\\n\\nAverage of all rows percentage at the bottom of this view\",\n                \"The total uninsured population 18 years of age to 64 years of age\",\n                \"Total estimated Population 18 years of age to 64 years of age\",\n                \"The population under 18 years of age and uninsured margin of error percentage \",\n                \"The Percentage of Population under 18 years of age  that are uninsured\",\n                \"The Margin of Error Population number of uninsured under the age of 18\",\n                \"Population Under the age of 18 that is uninsured\",\n                \"Margin of Error Total Population under the age of 18\",\n                \"Percentage of the Uninsured population for each county.\",\n                \"Margin of error number of uninsured individuals in a county\",\n                \"Estimated number of uninsured individuals in the County\",\n                \"MOE number for the Population of the demographic area which in this case in the County. \\nA Margin of Error (MOE) is the difference between an estimate and its upper or lower confidence bounds.\\nConfidence bounds are created by adding the MOE to the estimate and subtracting the margin of\\nerror from the estimate.
