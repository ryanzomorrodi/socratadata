Bus staff that encounter delays during the route are instructed to radio the dispatcher at the bus vendor’s central office. The bus vendor staff are then instructed to log into the Bus Breakdown and Delay system to record the event and notify OPT. OPT customer service agents use this system to inform parents who call with questions regarding bus service. The Bus Breakdown and Delay system is publicly accessible and contains real time updates. All information in the system is entered by school bus vendor staff.",

For OPT, the term \"field trip\" is a contract term referring to any mid-day trip, including work programs as well as traditional field trips to the museum.\n•\tSpecial Ed AM Run – curb-to-curb service in the morning with pick-ups at residences and drop-offs at school(s).\n•\tSpecial Ed PM Run - curb-to-curb service in the afternoon with pick-ups at school(s) and drop-offs at residences.\n•\tSpecial Ed Field Trip - refers to any mid-day bus trip that includes at least one student with an IEP for busing.

OPT provides curb-to-curb busing to Pre-K students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for busing and selected children in the Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Early Intervention program.\n•\tProject Read PM Run – curb-to-curb busing service for special education students enrolled in late-day programs.

There is a process for bus vendors to submit these Problem Runs to OPT staff for research and resolution. While that work is being done, bus vendors can record routes as being delayed by selecting the Problem Run category.\n•\tWeather Conditions - to be selected by the reporting bus vendor when weather conditions delay the scheduled service.\n•\tWon't Start - to be selected by the reporting bus vendor when a bus that has already left the bus yard won't start.

All bus lanes have signs posted along the route with specific regulations; lanes marked \"Bus Only\" and /or painted red. Bus lanes help to keep buses from getting stuck in traffic, generally making travel for bus riders faster and reliable and improving the overall traffic flow of a corridor. Each record represents a segment of a bus lane based on the LION geographic base file of NYC streets. User may use the SegmentID field in this dataset to join with the LION data for more information.",

For Mesa this is clearly impacting routes 156, 531, and 541, however, there are minor anomalies with some of the other routes. \n\nBreakdown of bus service ridership on a monthly basis per route in Mesa (data lags for approximately 30 days) and data is provided by Valley Metro, an external agency who is responsible for both bus service and light rail in Mesa. For a regional view of both bus service and light rail ridership, please go to their website, under their Publications/Reports section. Valley Metro tracks bus riders as they board. Bus service expands the scope and range of light rail, in addition to being a geographically more flexible means of public transportation in comparison to light rail. \n\nThe data set captures information starting in July 2013. Effective October 24, 2016, AZ Link has been consolidated with route 112, and the Main Street Link consolidated with route 40.\n\nData reporting can be delayed up to 60 days.",
